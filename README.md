<h1 align="center">EasyFNC-Zero</h1>

This repository hopes to provide zero-dependency (in terms of Python packages) and a highly extendable interface to interact with LLMs via function calling, easily. The main goal of this repository is to be able to `git pull` this repository, extend the `EasyFNCModel` class, add your functions to `easy_fnc/functions.py` and start using it with your LLMs asap. It ships with [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) support out of the box.

## Requirements

* Python 3.10+

and well, that's it. No other dependencies are required. For use with Ollama, you will need to install it separately. Instructions can be found [here](https://ollama.com/download).

## Usage

To be updated.
