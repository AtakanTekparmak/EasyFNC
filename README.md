<h1 align="center">EasyFNC</h1>

This repository hopes to provide a modular and highly extendable interface to interact with LLMs via function calling, easily. The main goal of this repository is to be able to `git pull` this repository, install Ollama & Ollama Python, add your functions to `easy_fnc/functions.py` and start using it with your LLMs asap. It only ships with [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) support out of the box so far.

## Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download)

and well, that's it. 

## Installation

If the requirements are met, you can install the dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
